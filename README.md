<h3> Project Description </h3>
<h5>This project is done using MEAN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)</h5>
<p>Our team has been hired to build an online reservation system simulation for a virtual airline company. The system will be comprised of a single page web application using mongodb, nodejs, and angular.The application is also extended to support an IOS & Android mobile platform.</p>
<p>
The airline company has initially requested the system support a very basic workflow:
</br>
 • Allow any user to specify his/her travel location(s) and dates</br>
 • Provide all available (from/to) flights</br>
 • Select, confirm, and pay for flights
